		<description>I kinda like your side and would bet on it.  It&#039;s really hard to gain muscle mass strength training after the initial gain.  Some builders work year round just to maintain or add 1-2 lbs.  If he&#039;s been at it a while it&#039;s gonna be tough.  He can bloat with water and creatine but to get his normal morning bodyweight to 180 from 165 by yers end is essentially impossible.</description>

		<description>ya i&#039;m not sure either, maybe bet me with the same bet as gravy, i.e. you win if gravy wins and i lose, and i win if i win and gravy loses.  or maybe just straight up whether i make it or not.  i feel like i&#039;m a fav to make it but i could def be overestimating my motivation too.  the weird thing is obv the more action i get the more motivation i&#039;ll have.</description>

		<description>If I didn&#039;t know anything about spacegravy, I would probably bet on you, since it&#039;s easier to lose body fat than gainning some pounds of muscle. That said..., I&#039;m under the impression that spacegravy just doesn&#039;t lose bets...
